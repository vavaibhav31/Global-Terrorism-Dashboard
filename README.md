## 📘 Overview

This project analyzes terrorism trends using three complementary datasets:

- **Global Terrorism Database (GTD):** Incident-level data across countries since 1970  
- **Global Terrorism Index (GTI) vs Human Development Index (HDI):** Measures developmental impact of terrorism  
- **Migration Dataset:** Evaluates how terrorism may influence international displacement

Designed for policymakers, analysts, and the general public, this dashboard translates complex data into intuitive visuals, fostering informed decisions and awareness.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize **global and regional terrorism patterns**
- Identify **key target types, attack methods, and affected regions**
- Examine the relationship between **GTI and HDI**
- Explore migration displacement trends potentially linked to terrorism
- Apply **data storytelling techniques** to drive stakeholder engagement

---

## 🔍 Features

- **Regional Terrorism Dashboard**  
  Interactive analysis by region, year, attack type, and target group

- **GTI vs HDI Correlation**  
  Scatterplot highlighting the developmental consequences of terrorism

- **Migration Patterns**  
  Explore possible displacement effects using contextual overlays

- **Advanced Visual Design**  
  Utilizes icon filters, illusion techniques, and storytelling formats to improve readability and clarity

## 📂 Datasets Used

| Dataset | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)** | START (UMD) | Incident-level terrorism data from 1970 onward |
| **GTI vs HDI** | Global Peace Index, UNDP | Merged index to analyze impact on development |
| **Migration** | World Bank, UNHCR | Used to provide context on displacement patterns |

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Visualization:** Tableau Public  
- **Data Cleaning & Prep:** Microsoft Excel, Python (for merging/cleaning)  
- **Design:** Dashboard actions, parameters, icon filters

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Countries with high GTI scores often exhibit lower HDI, suggesting a developmental burden from sustained terrorism  
- Civilian populations and government infrastructure remain the most common targets  
- Storytelling-driven visuals improve communication of complex data to non-technical stakeholders
